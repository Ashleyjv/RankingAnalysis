But sometimes it's a car that's subtly styled, blends sensible efficiency with easy capabilities and features the usual assortment of tech and options that really does the trick. If you're looking for a smart do-it-all everyday sedan, a used Chevy Malibu is a great way to go.

At the Hertz location near you, expect updated, like-new versions of the Malibu, with appropriately low mileage, updated tech for infotainment and safety and several amenities that you'll appreciate taking with you for all your travels.

Finding the right fit at Hertz Car Sales, while easy and affordable, can be a bit overwhelming with the number of different SUV styles we have available. But with a used Kia Sportage , you'll find an excellent everyday small SUV at a price that works for your budget. You'll first notice that the majority of used Kia Sportage editions we have available around the country are from recent model years. That means you'll find this small crossover, which is already affordably priced while being extremely well-equipped, with low mileage and updated tech for safety, infotainment and convenience. From there, you'll want to consider a couple engine options, versions with all-wheel drive, and certain setups of the Kia Sportage that are better suited for off-road adventures or everyday, in-town driving. Shop online or visit Hertz Car Sales today and you'll also find great deals among our Used Kia Sportage Under $20,000 ! Whichever style of used Kia Sportage you're after, you'll want to apply for financing early on before visiting the Hertz Car Sales location in your area. That will prepare you to secure a smart and sensible used car loan that makes sense for the particular pre-owned Kia Sportage you're buying, and for the budget you've set out with. And thanks to our no-haggle policy, we set our prices lower than market rates, keeping you from needing to negotiate for a better deal or shopping around for a lighter burden on your wallet. We add further confidence to your savvy purchase through our complimentary warranty coverage, with additional protection plans available to add as well. See if a used Kia Sportage is the right fit in a small SUV from Hertz Car Sales by visiting the location near you today. We make every effort to provide accurate information including but not limited to price, mileage, and vehicle options. Vehicle image for demonstration purposes only.

Today, it is one of the most widely sold cars in the UK; in 2022, it had the sixth most number of units sold, contributing to Kia hitting 100,000 UK sales for the first time and achieving a record-breaking market share of 6.2%. Globally, the Sportage has been Kia’s most sold car since 2016. Affordable, practical and with hybrid technology available, the Kia Sportage is now one of the most popular family cars on the road. It rivals other family SUVs such as the Honda ZR-V , the Renault Austral and the Nissan Qashqai. Kia Sportage updates and facelifts First launched in Europe in 1995, the Mk1 Sportage was available either as a boxy, five-door SUV or as a three-door convertible. Further versions arrived from the mid-noughties, with the Mk2 in 2006 followed by a Mk3 in 2010. This third iteration saw a big increase in the size of the Sportage compared to previous versions. After Road & Travel Magazine in the US awarded it International Car of the Year, its sales increased dramatically. The first three generations of the Sportage were all available with both petrol and diesel engines. The fourth generation of the Sportage entered the UK market in 2016, and further increased Kia’s market share. The Mk4 was the first Sportage to offer hybrid technology and remains popular on the second-hand car market today. The arrival of the Sportage Mk5 came in 2022 to wide acclaim. In 2023, What Car? Awarded the Sportage the Best Family SUV title. The Mk5 offers a broad range of hybrid powertrains, as well as petrol and diesel options. Practicality and style of the car One of the most significant draws of the Kia Sportage is its practicality. While the Mk3 brought more space than its predecessors, it’s the Mk4 and Mk5 that really draw in plaudits for their practical nature. The Mk5 has a width of 1,865mm, a length of 4,515mm and a height of 1,645mm, making it 90mm or 52mm longer and 50mm or 7mm wider than the Nissan Qashqai and the Renault Austral respectively. KIA pride themselves on offering a 7-year warranty with their cars – this is transferred when sold on, making the popular Sportage a great value used car. The Mk4 has 491 litres of capacity with all seats up, reduced slightly in the mild hybrid versions to make space for the battery. With the rear seats down, the space opens up to 1,480 litres (or 1,428 litres in the hybrid). The Mk5 increases the spaciousness even further. Boot space comes in at 591 litres, far outdoing the Honda ZR-V’s 380 litres, and also beating other competitors like the Renault Austral, "

Decided to wait and explore my options. Then McKenzie called me this month about some new deals. She got me some quotes and they were able to locate the exact vehicle I was wanting (2023 Taos, Pure Gray)! This vehicle has more options than I even thought about! Within a weeks time of getting the quote and putting down a deposit for them to locate one, I drove away with a brand new ride! Derek kept me informed on the status and when I was able to come get it. Derek and Alex sat with me in the car and showed me all the cool things with the vehicle. Alex helped get My VW app installed and up and running. I want to thank all of them, I am a very happy new car owner!! 2020 Nissan Sentra SR review Stylish August 28, 2022 By Dennis from Glen Allen, Virginia Owns this car Rides well.  Got some pep.

For Rent2Buy vehicles mileage stated is an estimate and we utilize the mileage provided in reservation confirmations as point of reference. Advertised prices exclude all taxes, tag, title, registration fees, government fees, finance charge, dealer document processing charge, and any emission testing charge. In order to retain the 25Ecredit eligibility following the return of a purchased vehicle, the vehicle must be returned within 48 hours from completing the time of sale with the IRS. Any vehicle return beyond such 48-hour period is not eligible to be cancelled or voided through the IRS and may result in my loss of eligibility for the 25Ecredit on a future purchase.

Some of the smaller SUVs we drove were noisy, and I felt every bump on the road, some of the larger SUVs were just too big. I was impressed with how quiet this car was and how it smoothed out lot of the rough roads that we have here in California. We have the SEL model with a 2.5 L turbo charged engine that has plenty of power and decent fuel economy. I get over 30 miles per gallon on the highway and 25 miles per gallon in town.

Five years later the Mk2 arrived, but it was with the third generation model, launched in 2012, that this family SUV really hit its stride. Boasting smart styling and an extended seven-seat interior, it offered more than ever to large families, rivalling contemporaries such as the Kia Sportage and Nissan X-Trail . Hyundai Santa Fe updates and facelifts Such was the Mk3’s appeal that it scooped several awards, from the Auto Express Best Large SUV accolades in both 2013 and 2014 to Honest John’s Most Popular SUV award in 2015. A single diesel engine was offered with a choice of manual or automatic transmission, two or four-wheel drive, and three trim levels. A facelift followed in 2016, which brought a raft of innovative tech. Hyundai didn’t tamper with a winning formula. When the Mk4 Santa Fe launched in 2018, it again came with a single diesel engine and two and four-wheel drive options. In 2021, however, the model was revised heavily, switching the diesel engine for a choice of self-charging hybrid or plug-in hybrid powertrains, and offering sharper, more attention-grabbing styling. The updates paid off: the Santa Fe won a slew of What Car? Awards, including Large SUV of the Year in 2022, and both Seven-seater of the Year and Best Plug-in Hybrid for Big Families in 2023. As a family SUV, the Santa Fe offers abundant space, impressive reliability and a high-quality interior, making it excellent value for money.  If you choose a model from 2021 onwards, there are only Premium and Ultimate trims to select from. The standard kit is generous, helping ensure all journeys are connected, entertaining and safe. Practicality and style of the car Practicality is at the heart of the Hyundai Santa Fe. The Mk3 car comes with five seats as standard, offering an additional two seats when you step up to the Premium SE trim. Whichever suits you best, you’ll benefit from lots of legroom in both the front and rear. The third row is designed for children and teens but provides them with adequate space to travel in comfort. The Mk4 builds on this, offering enough width to easily accommodate three adults in the middle row and room for a couple of adults in the third row seats. Even rivals such as the ŠKODA Kodiaq and Land Rover Discovery Sport can’t claim as much rear space. What’s more, third row passengers get their own climate controls for optimum comfort on the journey, while ISOFIX anchor points ar"

Needed new TIE ROD ENDS, March 11, 2023 By Health care eirker from Warren,Mi Owns this car Trying to get reimbursed for failed TIR ROD ENDS THAT CAUSED CRASH at 73,00/ miles.

Consider the Ford Fusion. The car came into the market to rival leading superminis in the multi-purpose vehicle category.

It makes a great used car purchase due to its affordability, handling and urban prowess. If you're in need of a runaround for city living, this is an excellent cost-effective choice. What You Get It's increased height and ruggedness make for a great city car, as it easily copes with common urban problems, such as speed bumps or tight corners. Seating room is generous, with plenty of space for luggage. Unlike other Ford offerings, the trim levels were marketed as 1 , 2 , 3 , and + . The basic model features a cassette player, central locking and dual airbags, while the + has alloys, front fog lights, an alarm and a DVD player in the back. A redesign was released in 2005, featuring improved cosmetic changes and better electronics, such as an MP3 player. How it Drives This car handles as well as the Fiesta or Focus from the same time period. Efficiency is impressive for both petrol and diesel variants, "

The Fusion takes the Ford Fiesta's handling and marries it with extra headroom, more-upright seating and a bigger luggage capacity, to create a practical and useful small car. Two petrol engines are quiet and smooth and cope well on the motorway. The best diesel is the 1.6 TDCi, offering 60mpg+ and decent pulling power, while the 1.4-litre petrol comes with the Durashift EST gearbox, a clutchless system that takes the effort out of gear changes. The used Ford Fusion has a big cabin, split-folding rear seats and a large boot with over 1000 litres of load space with the rear seats folded down. Kit-wise, all trims feature driver and passenger airbags, central locking, leather steering wheel, split rear seats, bodycoloured bumpers and lots of stowage. The range-topping 3 (as in 1, 2 and 3) from the original line-up has 15-inch alloys, remote radio controls, boot net, central locking and perimeter alarm. Note that the latest trims are the Style, Style Climate, Zetec Climate and Fusion+. Key features of Ford cars are: • Huge name in the industry • Wide range • Well equipped • Excellent drivability More about Ford Fusion We found ? used cars that match your search.

The Mk1 arrived in the UK in 2002. Now in its fourth generation, it has become a frontrunner in the family SUV market, rivalling models such as the Nissan X-Trail and Land Rover Discovery Sport . Kia Sorento updates and facelifts The Mk2 Sorento debuted in 2010, with the Mk3 arriving in 2014. The third generation offers customers a choice of five or seven seats as well as an impressive level of equipment. The current iteration, the Mk4, was launched in 2020 and brought more engine options to the table, adding full hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants to the existing diesel line-up. The Sorento’s muscular styling and generous dimensions give it an imposing presence out on the road. A sweeping roofline and crisp contours give the model a sporty feel, while high ground clearance and roof rails demonstrate its adventurous nature. Trim levels for vehicles produced between 2020 and July 2022 include the 2, 3 and 4, with each boasting a more comprehensive level of kit. Thereafter, Kia slimmed down its options to a single trim: the ‘Edition’, which is based on the 4 trim. Practicality and style of the car Whether you’re searching for a spacious vehicle to accommodate your growing family, a reliable option for fleet use, or something with impressive towing capabilities, a used Kia Sorento ranks highly. Available in five and seven-seat options, it’s an ideal solution for large families, and can comfortably seat three adults in the second row thanks to sliding seats that enable passengers to maximise their legroom. The third row is better suited to younger children, and can be folded flat to create more luggage space. In the Mk4, folding the third row seats provides 604-litres of boot space in the PHEV, 608-litres in the full hybrid and 616-litres in the diesel. Flip the second row of seats down as well and you’ll have between 1,988 and 2,011-litres of luggage capacity – that’s more than the SEAT Tarraco and Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace , which offer 1,775 litres and 1,920 litres respectively. If you’re towing a trailer, horsebox or caravan, you’ll find the Sorento up to the task. The automatic can pull a braked trailer of up to 2,000kg, while the manual variant is even tougher, with a towing capacity of 2,500kg. Running costs The Kia Sorento Mk3 occupies insurance groups 24-28 (out of 50), making it an affordable option in terms of running costs. The KX-1 trim offers the best value, with higher trims such as the KX-3 and KX-4 sitting in the higher insurance groups. Choose a Mk4 variant and you’re looking at a slightly higher p"

This car has been a top choice for families since its introduction in 1972. Its popularity is still clear today, as 2018's Mk8 and its 2019 facelift are well-loved options. Both saw Volkswagen focus on the compact executive saloon class, with the Volkswagen Passat Mk8 comparable to the Audi A4 , BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class . All used Volkswagen Passats made before 2019 come in saloon and estate versions. All estate versions are available in the same trims as the saloon, with the additional Alltrack trim. Volkswagen Passat updates and facelifts This car competes strongly within its class with a high-quality feel, advanced technical features and ample storage space. Thanks to its lighter platform design, drivers will experience smooth handling while riding in comfort. The Volkswagen Passat takes care of the driver, passengers, and their belongings – great for families who regularly embark on longer road trips. The Volkswagen Passat comes with both diesel and petrol engines with cylinder shift-off technology. There are six-speed manual and seven-speed DSG auto gearboxes available. Practicality and style of the car The Volkswagen Passat comfortably seats a family of two adults and three children or a group of four adults. The Mk8 has a much longer wheelbase than previous generations, with added interior space. Both the Passat saloon and estate are 4,767mm in length, 1,832mm in width and 1,456mm tall. This height means getting in and out of the car is easy for everyone. While previous generations didn’t lack space, Volkswagen has elevated the Passat’s appeal with extra room, making the Mk8 a great option. Boot space is impressive, with additional room in Volkswagen Passats after 2015 and increased further in 2019 following its facelift. The saloon has a capacity of 585 litres with the seats up and is one of the best in its class, with its competitor BMW 3 Series only having 480 litres of boot space. With a 60/40 split on all trims, folded-down seats create an impressive 1,152 litres of space. Every door has personal storage cubbies, suitable for belongings or a one-litre bottle. All trims have ISOFIX fixings in the rear seats for car seats, making this an ideal family car. With significant boot space, personal storage and impressive legroom, the Volkswagen Passat is a highly practical car for families that are looking for easy access and ample storage. Depending on the generation and trim you choose, this car has a braked towing capacity starting at 1,500kg up to 2,200kg. You'll have no trouble transporting b"

It is simply a legend. The blue-collar Ferrari was the fastest-selling car in history when it was launched in the mid-1960s, offering as it did an alluring blend of value for money, dramatic, sporty styling and beefy V8 power (at least in some models). In Blighty, we had to wait until 2015 and the sixth-generation Mustang to get an officially imported right-hand-drive version of the American icon. That’s probably a good thing, though, because it’s also one of the best iterations of the Mustang since the 1964 original. A long bonnet and muscular-looking curves imply some serious grunt and, provided you go for the 5.0-litre V8 version (better still some of the special editions such as the Bullitt or the Mach 1) you’ll find an engine – and an engine note – that delivers just that. There is a 2.3-litre four-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost version, too, but that was dropped at the end of 2020 and only accounted for 15 per cent of UK sales. It’s a reasonable engine, similar to the one you’ll find in the most recent Ford Focus RS. But in a car that’s as American as having bacon with your pancakes, it just doesn’t feel quite right.

The model is known for its practicality, superb fuel economy and unmistakable style. The Focus is one of Ford’s most recognisable models, selling over 16 million units since its initial release. It has a well-earned reputation as a practical and performance-driven model. Inside, there’s plenty of comfort and storage space, making it a great choice for families. It comes with a selection of petrol and diesel engines. The Focus is an excellent choice of car for a wide range of different drivers. Compact and efficient, the Ford Focus is a rival to similar models like the Volkswagen Golf , Vauxhall Astra and Honda Civic . The Ford Focus has a long and multi-award-winning history. Ever since winning European Car of the Year in 1999, it has remained one of the most popular models in its class. Ford Focus updates and facelifts The Ford Focus has been around since 1998. Ford introduced the Mk1 Focus to replace the much-loved Ford Escort. It was available as a three-door hatchback, four-door saloon and five-door estate. It received a mid-life facelift in 2001. The facelift revised the model’s headlights, bumpers and front grille and added new paintwork colours. The Mk1 went on to achieve instantaneous success by winning Car of the Year 1999 in both Europe and the USA. The second generation of the Ford Focus launched in 2004. Compared to the first generation, the Mk2 was heavier and larger. More space was offered in the cabin and boot as the wheelbase was 25mm longer and the length was 168mm longer. The Mk2 was available with a wide range of petrol or diesel engines. New technology on the model included Ford’s KeyFree System with Power Starter Button. Adaptive front lighting and a solar-reflect windshield were also incorporated on the Mk2. It received a facelift in 2008 that restyled the exterior to bring it more in line with Ford’s contemporary design. Also adding a revised set of soft-touch plastics on the interior, revised the trim range and new colours to the interior. The third generation of the Focus launched in 2010 as a saloon and hatchback. This generation saw the introduction of a 2.0-litre direct injection diesel engine. The cabin was also redesigned with new materials and a new infotainment system. The Mk3 received a facelift in 2015. This added new head and rear lights, a new front grille and a new 1.5-litre EcoBoost engine. The Mk4 Focus was released in 2018. The Mk4 has a 53mm-longer wheelbase and is 88kg lighter than the previous generation. It also came with a new set of trims, including the premium Vignale trim. Ext"

She wanted a 2016 dark blue jeep Cherokee with heated wheel and seats 
And with all the other fun toys.
We tried local dodge dealers and was told we had to settle for what was on the lot. Well not with york. They found the exact jeep my mom wanted in ST Louis Missouri and even delivered it straight to our house with no extra cost. They did the best like seriously with customer service like that i don&apos;t mind the hour drive to know i will be treated well.

Most brands have at least one economy car, which might be limited in space but provides excellent fuel economy and the kind of sensible setup for a solo commuter. For one of the best small car options, especially if you're shopping used, a pre-owned Toyota Corolla is the way to go. Check out the entire stock of used Corolla models offered from Hertz Car Sales, and see what editions are available near you. What makes a used Toyota Corolla such a sensible option? Beyond the typical qualities you're seeking out of a small sedan, such as impressive fuel economy figures - with many Corolla editions getting close to 40 mpg on the highway - and drivability, Toyota tends to make cars that retain their value across several thousand miles, plenty of years and a few different owners. That will make any like-new, lower mileage Corolla, or an older, more affordable version, a great investment for your daily commuting. Test Drive a Hertz Certified Toyota Corolla Today Because we typically sell newer used vehicles, the latest Corolla editions should come with Toyota's standard safety features, giving you added confidence and security during your daily commutes to work and back home again. When you combine that overall amazing setup that you'll find with our Hertz benefits like the limited powertrain warranty coverage, you know you've found an amazing deal at a used car seller that does things a little differently. Head on over to the Hertz Car Sales store near you to find the perfect used Corolla for all your daily travels.

That's not to say that it's out for the count, however, as the car still tops sales charts around the globe. It's best known for its reliability, earning respect among the packed family car market. 2007 was the last year that the Corolla could be bought in the UK, so there are plenty of bargains to be found if you look hard enough. What You Get Early variants of the Toyota Corolla were well-equipped for the time, although they may be sparse compared to modern standards. Post-1997 models have an improved interior trim, with plenty of features, including air-con, electric windows and a sunroof.

The Lancer is a very good car. Even when checking other reviews, it is obvious that it is just built to be good. Dealerships are actually seeking these vehicles out and are willing to pay more for trade in because of the popularity. Over the seven years that I have owned this vehicle, with over 100k miles it hasn't yet had major issues. View More Amanda L. Red Bank, South Carolina 5.0 Absolutely love this car I financed this car after owning a beautiful 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

Car manufacturers often talk of the 'halo effect' of a flagship model. In short, it's spreading the glamour of a well-renowned car onto lesser lights in the range. There are any number of BMW 3 Series drivers who have fantasised about owning an M3 and when this marketing tactic is pursued well it can prove profitable. For a case study in the halo effect falling rather flat on its face, look no further than the Mitsubishi Lancer. To many, the Lancer is the Lancer Evo, the all-wheel drive, turbocharged rally replica that comes laced with a heavy dose of Tommi Makinen forest stage heroics or Police, Camera, Action starring roles, depending on your viewpoint. The Evo didn't create a halo effect. It was so incandescent it cast the rest of the ordinary Lancer range into the darkest shadow.
All of which was a bit of a shame as by the time this generation Lancer appeared in British showrooms in 2008, it had developed into a more than respectable car; certainly something that was a bit more interesting than the usual Astra/Focus/Megane norm. Here's what to look for if you fancy giving it a second chance, second time round. About the Mitsubishi Lancer The Mitsubishi Lancer earns its spurs as a used car because of its peerless reliability. How do you put a price on that? The 2.0-litre diesels are a great pick and the practical Sportback bodystyle still looks great. The 240PS Ralliart sports version is an interesting niche model that flies under the hot hatch radar and makes a great left-field alternative to something like a Focus ST. In all, the Lancer earns a solid recommendation. It may not have done the business for Mitsubishi as a new car but as a used one, it could well work for you. × Alert OK × Please Confirm OK Cancel Please enter a postcode We need your postcode to provide the most accurate results Continue Representative finance example If your borrow amount is £7,000 with a deposit of £1,000, a selected term of 48 months, at a representative APR of 17.9% (fixed) and an annual fixed interest rate of 17.9%, you would pay £171.83 per month.

Explore Technology Toyota Safety Sense™ 3.0 Pre-Collision System With Pedestrian Detection Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) is designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist or motorcyclist and provide an audio/visual forward-collision warning under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking. Learn More Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control Intended for highway use, Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) is an adaptive cruise control system that is designed to be set at speeds above 20 mph and uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control to help maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you. Learn More Lane Departure Alert With Steering Assist When white/yellow lane markings or certain road-edge boundary lines are detected at speeds above 30 mph, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA) is designed to issue an audio/visual lane-departure warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If the driver does not take corrective action, the system is also designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane-keeping assistance. Learn More Lane Tracing Assist When Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) is enabled and lane markers are detected, Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) uses the lines on the road and/or preceding vehicles to provide active driving assistance and help keep the vehicle centered in its lane. While LTA is activated, the Emergency Drive Stop System (EDSS) is designed to monitor the driver's inputs, such as steering operation.

The Prius has a hybrid drivetrain , combined with an internal combustion engine and an electric motor . Initially offered as a four-door sedan , it has been produced only as a five-door liftback since 2003.

The Prius isn't really coloured green. Not literally. But perhaps it should be. Because it's been designed and built with the environment in mind, and it's one of the most eco-friendly cars around. It's even âgreener' than other well-known eco cars such as the Kia Niro SUV and Hyundai Ioniq, and it came first in the Best Eco Car category of the 2016 Telegraph Cars Awards. But there's much more to the Prius than an environmentally-friendly design. The latest models are also a lot of fun to drive. Now, don't go thinking that, with the Prius, you're getting a sporting saloon or hatchback such as the BMW 3 Series or Volkswagen Golf GTE. Because you're not. But you will get a car that delivers a smooth and comfortable ride, coupled with very respectable performance (the 1.8L petrol unit will take you from 0 - 62mph in 10.6 seconds). The inside's good, too. True, its aesthetics won't appeal to everyone,   but there's no denying they're distinctive, with a futuristic, even slightly space-shippy, look. One advantage of this is the sense of space and tranquility it gives to driver and passengers. The Prius is well-equipped, too, with the Toyota Touch 2 and DAB radio as standard, and a lot of attractive options that include an advanced satnav and the premium JBL sound system (with the Excel model only). So, if you're looking for an ultra-green car which also deliver performance and quality - this may be the answer! Or you may want to consider a used Toyota Prius.

February 15, 2024 By Sylvia Beach  from Indianapolis, IN Nathan was helpful, and patient.  I love my 2010 Rav4, even though the mileage was high, others were deterred by this, but I wasn't.  A Toyota is a dependable, long-lasting automobile, as CarX pointed out.  Nathan put in a new windshield and mirror for me which was the extra mile, in my opinion. 2014 Nissan Versa Note SV review Transmission issues September  7, 2023 By B from Kailua-Kona Hawaii Owns this car I like the size of the vehicle it’s small and zippy. The gas is great when it comes to HIGHWAY MILES. My 2014 Note transmission is needing to be replaced at 120,000, if the transmission wasn’t an issue I would give this car 5 stars easy.

When I brought it back in to say it was not fixed they told me that the booster pump was bad but that it had to be ordered from Tennessee, which would take a week.  This delay, which could have been fixed by ordering it the first time I came in, is now costing me an additional $600 to rent a car for our vacation, in addition to the $750 it is costing me to replace the booster pump.  I am not happy that this has happened.  The reason I brought it in the first time was so that it would be ready for vacation.  Maybe there was no way to avoid this problem, but it sure looks like it could have been avoided. 2017 Jeep Patriot High Altitude review MY third Jeep September  1, 2023 By Terry T. from Fort Wayne, IN Owns this car After my others I rank this one as my favorite.

The legendary company has been at the forefront of off road autos for years, and the Patriot is a fine example of a modern variant of a true classic.  it's a big, rugged, unmistakable monster that won't let you down, and that's exactly what you'd want from a Jeep. Originally introduced in 2007, the Patriot has proved very popular in the USA and Europe.  It looks exactly how a Jeep should with its trademark front grille and boxy shape, and an authoritative presence is exuded from every inch of it.  Inside there's a lot of plastic but everything looks solid, and there's a huge amount of headroom.  The boot is a decent size, so anything from camping supplies to shopping could fit in without issue.  With a good amount of kit as standard, you'll be impressed with what's available across every level of trim. While looks, design and practicality are one thing, it's the actual driving e"

It's unmistakably a Jeep, with styling cues taken from the older Cherokee. In 2008 a smoother look to the instrument panel was introduced alongside a redesigned centre console and door panels. In 2011 the model got a facelift, improved trim and the Mercedes 2.2-litre diesel engine. All Patriots are four-wheel drive with Jeep's Freedom Drive 1 system that drives the front wheels most of the time and transfers power to the back only as needed. What You Get Trim levels are Sport and Limited in early cars with the 2011 facelift adding Sport+ trim in between and Overland at the top end. All used Patriots have a good spec list, including front and curtain airbags, 17-inch alloy wheels, air con, electric windows, adjustable steering column, ABS, stability control and roll mitigation. Limited versions get leather trim plus an infotainment system including six-CD audio, MP3 compatibility and Bluetooth. The 2011 Patriot facelift brings hill start assist and leather handbrake and steering wheel to Sport models. The Limited gets a power operated driver's seat. Buy the top of the range Overland and you get 18-inch alloys, classier leather seats, rear park assist, tyre pressure monitoring and chrome scuff plates on the sills. How it Drives The Jeep Patriot is a fairly compact car and is lighter than some rivals, so it turns in decent performance. The 2.0 diesel will do the 0-62 sprint in 11 seconds and top out at 117 mph. The 2.4 petrol accelerates fractionally quicker (10.7) but can only manage 112. The diesel gives you more mid-range pulling power but can feel a bit sluggish at low speed when it's off boost. Body roll is well controlled and the full-time 4x4 system gives plenty of grip, so it inspires confidence on the road. It's a much more capable off-roader than its size and styling might suggest. The front seats have plenty of adjustment, so it's comfortable on "

It is a good-looking and practical car aimed at the family market. Originally it was only available with one engine, a 2.5-litre diesel engine and with a choice of four trims, the entry-level S, SE, SVE and top-of-the-range T. The S trim has five seats and all the others have seven. Later in 2005, Nissan added a V6 4.0-litre petrol engine to the range. In 2006, the entire range was revised and prices cut considerably. The trim levels were now known as Aventura , Sport and Trek. In 2008, the base-level Trek trim was gifted an extra row of seats, making all-new 7-seater Pathfinder. What You Get The used Nissan Pathfinder is suited equally well to off-road and on-road "

These people should avoid the used Nissan Pathfinder, because this is one 4x4 that means business. The Pathfinder is built to tow for England while shrugging off everything Mother Nature can chuck at it. The used Nissan Pathfinder was boosted in 2010 with a more potent 190bhp 2.5 dCi diesel, which actually reduced its emissions. A 4-litre V6 petrol is also available, with a 0-60mph time of 8.6 seconds. Goodies on the used entry-level Nissan Pathfinder S include alloys, dual-zone climate control, CD, heated door mirrors and electric windows. With the SE, you also get front fogs, privacy glass, roof rails and three rows of seats. The SVE provides leather seats, cruise control, rain-sensing wipers and automatic headlamps. Go for the top-of-the range T-Spec and you'll enjoy electric sunroof, DVD sat-nav and colour reversing camera. Trims were rebranded in 2006 to Trek, Sport and Aventura, and from 2009 just the Acenta and Tekna. More about Nissan Pathfinder We found ? used cars that match your search.

Throughout this evolution, a number of substantial developments have taken place. Toyota Yaris updates and facelifts The arrival of the Mk2 Yaris in 2006, followed by the Mk3 in 2011, each mark a step in the model’s evolution in terms of style and performance. The arrival of the Toyota Yaris Mk4 in 2020 saw the iconic model embrace hybrid-only performance. What’s remained constant throughout the lifetime of the Yaris is the devotion to providing affordable, safe and low-emission motoring that’s also fun. In addition to the ample interior space and comfort, the Yaris also embraces the best in automotive technology. Whether it’s cutting-edge driver-assistance measures – the Toyota Safety Sense suite of features aids in helping to detect collision risks, for example – or infotainment, this supermini is at the forefront of innovation. Indeed, the Toyota Yaris was the first supermini to introduce a touchscreen display, a feature that is now common to compact cars across all marques. With an array of trim levels available, the Yaris is a model that suits a wide variety of demands, from first-time drivers needing an affordable and easy-to-drive runaround, to experienced motorists looking to downsize their model for something more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. With its compact dimensions, the vehicle glides in and out of urban traffic with ease, while the deceptively spacious interior offers greater head and legroom than rivals such as the Vauxhall Corsa and the Mazda 2 . This being a Toyota, you can also be assured of the build quality and the distinctiveness of the design. Fourth-generation models in particular are noticeably sporty, with their angled headlights and sculpted front fascia. Meanwhile, a range of trim options and alloy wheel designs enables you to select a model that’s sure to stand out. Practicality and style of the car Whichever generation of the Yaris you opt for, practicality is assured. This can be partly attributed to Toyota’s desire to create a model with broad appeal. The 5-door design makes entering the vehicle easy, and the cabin provides a remarkable level of space compared to the competition. Thanks to the vehicle’s high roofline, the level of headroom will easily accommodate two adults, while the ISOFIX fittings on the two outer rear seats will enable parents to effortlessly transport children.

Chargers from model years 1966 through 1978 were built on a mid-size B-body platform, 1983 through 1987 saw a subcompact on the L-body platform, and from 2006 onward the Charger is a full-size sedan on Chrysler’s LX platform.

April 30, 2014 By Mike from Williamsport, IN Overall experience was very good from the sales person to the financing person. Facilities are in excellent conditions! Only two things that I see need improving.....I inquired online and did not receive any contact back from them. If my email was wrong, you should have at least tried to call me. You may have missed a sale. The other item that I am most disappointed in, is that I only asked for one thing, and that was to have the car detailed. In between the two front seats and under the seats is the same nasty filth that was left behind from the last owner. I really would have liked that cleaned up. I don't want this to be negative just pointing out a couple areas for improvement. Overall very good experience. 2011 Ford Edge Limited review SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL June  7, 2023 By Darrell C from Bakersfield  CA Owns this car The driver's side door latch is a known faulty unit and as it controls the auto locking mechanism is a s"

In an increasingly competitive large-car market, the Ford Edge is stylish, but it also brings its fair share of practicality, space and power to the table. With the States rooted in its DNA, it’s an SUV with character and charm that offers a smooth drive at all speeds and is packed with exciting technology to elevate the driving experience. Ford Edge updates and facelifts The Mk1 Ford Edge originally launched in North America back in 2007 as a bespoke SUV and earned its reputation stateside as a reliable ride with plenty of room for the family. Fast forward to 2017 and the Mk2 launched in the UK with a streamlined aesthetic and modernised interior. The Mk2 upgrade of the Edge also included plenty of touch-ups to ensure it is agile enough to take on tight urban side streets and winding lanes as comfortably as open A roads and motorways. Investment in a stiffer suspension and sharper steering ensure that as a family SUV the Ford Edge can handle whatever British roads throw at it. A minor facelift in 2019 saw additional aesthetic boosts; a reduced grille size is easier on the eye, and LED daytime running lamps bring a modern touch to the already contemporary exterior. Available in four diesel engines and with four-wheel drive as standard, the Mk2 that took to the British roads has smoother handling than its Mk1 predecessor. Practicality and style of a used Ford Edge A used Ford Edge has spaciousness on its side. As a larger SUV, it can easily accommodate five adults while offering plenty of legroom for both driver and passengers. Open the boot of the Ford Edge via its electronically controlled system, and you’ll be greeted by a huge 602 litres of available space. With plenty of room to fit a good amount of large luggage, this boot can hold more than any model of Audi, Mercedes or BMW, even outdoing the Honda CR-V ’s 589 litres. Fold the back seats down, and the capacity increases to more than triple the size at 1,847 litres, which is enough to be genuinely practical for the big life moments like moving house or driving the kids to university. ISOFIX points in the rear come with the bonus of child seat mounting brackets, ensuring quick installation. As a large SUV, most models of the Edge offer a towing capacity of 2,000kg, which is enough for a small caravan or a sizeable trailer. Running costs Despite its label as a large SUV, the Ford Edge is reasonable to run. It will sit within insurance groups 25 to 34 (out of 50) depending on the specification you choose. Annual road tax for a Ford Edge starts at as little as £180, up to £570 for the higher trim levels. How a used Ford Edge drives Used Ford Edges come in a range of diesel-powered engines, packing varied levels of power but with four-wheel drive as standard across the board. Two TDCi engines come with a choice of either manual or automatic transmission. The former reaches 177bhp, and while the latter achieves 207bhp, both return between 47.9 and 48.7mpg. More powerful still is the EcoBlue automatic engine, which can produce 234bhp. Its counterpart, the EcoBlue manual, produces a respectable 147bhp, with both options returning 40.9mpg. The Ford Edge is on a par with premium competition like the Volkswagen Touareg, while easily beating off other competitors like the Nissan X-Trail and the Kia Sorento. E"

This catered to people looking for a smaller SUV that could handle the urban jungle while maintaining some off-road capability. The Compass was instantly recognisable as a Jeep thanks to its seven-bar grille but the model put a greater focus on comfort. Jeep Compass updates and facelifts The Mk1 received a substantial update in 2011, which gave it a smarter cabin and some new equipment. It continued to provide an attractive alternative to the Ford Kuga until 2014, when it was retired. Following a brief hiatus, the Mk2 arrived in late 2017. With its modern styling, which embraces Jeep’s off-road roots, and its exceptional level of comfort and safety equipment, it’s a more attractive proposition than ever. It’s built on an extended version of the Jeep Renegade’s platform, meaning it offers more interior space. The Mk2 Jeep Compass received a facelift in 2021, which brought some exterior design tweaks, including full LED headlamps as standard across the range. More notable was the interior refresh, which gave the model a more prestige feel. A new 10.1-inch touchscreen became the focal point of a revised dash design, and the Uconnect 5 infotainment system was brought in, providing a more responsive experience. Initially available with two petrol and three diesel engines, the Compass’ later iterations boast greener powertrains: one petrol, one mild hybrid and one plug-in hybrid. Five trims include Sport, Longitude, Night Eagle, Limited and Trailhawk. The Compass has plenty of competition from models such as the Volkswagen Tiguan , the Volvo XC40 and the Honda CR-V , but none of these really match it for all-terrain prowess. This is a true crossover, being compact and nimble enough to tackle the demands of everyday life while retaining an adventurous spirit with the ability to go almost anywhere. Practicality and style of the car Jeep Compass buyers have one option of a five-door body style, which aligns with the brand’s emphasis on practicality. Access is easy, particularly if you’re travelling with young children – the wide-opening doors make it simple to get them in and secured in their child seats. There are ISOFIX anchor points on each outer rear seat. If you’re travelling with adults, they’ll have plenty of room to stretch out. The front and rear compartments both offer generous legroom, while the vehicle’s high roofline means there’s ample headroom. Boot space is equally impressive, with 438 cub"

Five years later the Mk2 arrived, but it was with the third generation model, launched in 2012, that this family SUV really hit its stride. Boasting smart styling and an extended seven-seat interior, it offered more than ever to large families, rivalling contemporaries such as the Kia Sportage and Nissan X-Trail . Hyundai Santa Fe updates and facelifts Such was the Mk3’s appeal that it scooped several awards, from the Auto Express Best Large SUV accolades in both 2013 and 2014 to Honest John’s Most Popular SUV award in 2015. A single diesel engine was offered with a choice of manual or automatic transmission, two or four-wheel drive, and three trim levels. A facelift followed in 2016, which brought a raft of innovative tech. Hyundai didn’t tamper with a winning formula. When the Mk4 Santa Fe launched in 2018, it again came with a single diesel engine and two and four-wheel drive options. In 2021, however, the model was revised heavily, switching the diesel engine for a choice of self-charging hybrid or plug-in hybrid powertrains, and offering sharper, more attention-grabbing styling. The updates paid off: the Santa Fe won a slew of What Car? Awards, including Large SUV of the Year in 2022, and both Seven-seater of the Year and Best Plug-in Hybrid for Big Families in 2023. As a family SUV, the Santa Fe offers abundant space, impressive reliability and a high-quality interior, making it excellent value for money.  If you choose a model from 2021 onwards, there are only Premium and Ultimate trims to select from. The standard kit is generous, helping ensure all journeys are connected, entertaining and safe. Practicality and style of the car Practicality is at the heart of the Hyundai Santa Fe. The Mk3 car comes with five seats as standard, offering an additional two seats when you step up to the Premium SE trim. Whichever suits you best, you’ll benefit from lots of legroom in both the front and rear. The third row is designed for children and teens but provides them with adequate space to travel in comfort. The Mk4 builds on this, offering enough width to easily accommodate three adults in the middle row and room for a couple of adults in the third row seats. Even rivals such as the ŠKODA Kodiaq and Land Rover Discovery Sport can’t claim as much rear space. What’s more, third row passengers get their own climate controls for optimum comfort on the journey, while ISOFIX anchor points ar"

I would suggest the ability to customize your vehicle for purchase at a dealership without huge cost to customer.
I would suggest to bring some of the products from the ChevyMall website to the dealership.
I would suggest making fog lights available on lower trim models since this is a safety item.
I would suggest relocating the center console cup holders, position feels awkward.

The Ford Fiesta is a supermini car introduced by Ford Motor Company in 1976. Since its introduction, the Fiesta has been one of Ford’s most successful and popular models, especially in Europe.

One of the most common sights on UK roads for decades, the Fiesta saw seven generations produced after first arriving on the market in 1976. 46 years on the market saw it reach an unparalleled level of popularity, and despite ceasing production in 2023 it remains the most sold car in the UK. With more than four million units sold, the Ford Fiesta has had a cultural impact that few, if any, cars can match. From its Mk1 to the launch of its final generation in 2017, the Fiesta, has seen a massive range of iterations. Primarily a hatchback, the Fiesta has also been sold as a panel van, a sedan and a saloon. The Mk7 range includes the Fiesta Active, a crossover SUV, and the Fiesta Vignale, a luxury alternative. The Mk7 Fiesta won Carbuyer’s Car of the Year in 2017 and has a host of awards to its name. As a streamlined, compact hatch, the Ford Fiesta is well suited to navigating tight urban streets, with the well-tuned suspension needed to handle city life. That said, its reliable power beneath the bonnet means it’s just as adept at taking on sprawling highways or winding country lanes. The Fiesta remains an extremely favourable option for those looking for a well-made car that can transport the whole family and easily nip around town. It competes with other popular family hatchbacks such as the Vauxhall Corsa , the Škoda Fabia and the Volkswagen Polo . Ford Fiesta updates and facelifts Across more than four and a half decades on the UK market, the Ford Fiesta has gone through seven generations and many facelifts. First produced in 1976, it was available as a three-door hatchback and a three-door panel van. The same applies to the Mk2, which launched in 1983, while the Mk3 was the first Fiesta to include a five-door model in its range. The bubbly design of the Mk4, launched in 1995, was a step away from the previous generations, but this too included a five-door model, as well as a four-door sedan. The fifth generation changed design once more in 2002, reverting to a boxier look than its predecessor. The final two iterations, the Mk6 (2008) and Mk7 (2017) brought the Fiesta well into the 21st century with sporty, streamlined body designs that appealed to a new, younger generation of drivers. Its final facelift in 2022 saw it finally remove the three-door option, leaving just the five-door Fiesta as the last on the market before it ceased production a year later. Practicality and style of the car Throughout the years, the range of Fiesta models has meant that the car can cater to the needs of all sorts of drivers, from the family-oriented to those seeking a "

Used Infiniti QX70 FAQs Why was the Infiniti QX70 discontinued? Nissan (the brand's parent company) chose to discontinue the Infiniti QX70 after 2017 because of low worldwide sales. Instead of continuing to build the QX70, the manufacturer refocused on the best-selling QX50 models. Is the Infiniti QX70 a good car?

How much does an Infiniti QX70 cost? As a luxury vehicle, the price of the Infiniti QX70 was on the higher side when the model was new.

August 15, 2023 By Dewey DeVaux from Leo, In. This was the 1st time in 35 years that I have bought a used car from another dealer. I was pleasantly surprised, I started with salesman Nate and ended with Brice. Both were great to work with. From the owner down all were very helpful in making sure that I was satisfied with my purchase. The lot had many used vehicles in my price range and different manufactures to choose from. I may not need another vehicle in my lifetime but, if I do, I will return to Raptor and I recommend them for your next used vehicle. Thanks to all and have a good year. 2012 Hyundai Accent GS review OK car May  4, 2021 By lisettecherry01@gmail.com from lisettecherry01@gmail.com Owns this car The car will work for "

The new Hyundai Accent combines stylish design, terrific handling, and the quality you expect from Hyundai into a car that will turn heads while getting you where you need to go with ease. The new Hyundai Accent is available now at Jeff Wyler Hyundai of Beavercreek, conveniently located just 15 minutes from Dayton. Design The Accent's design is a striking mix of sleekness and boldness. Its wide stance, sculpted hood, and striking front grille make an intense first impression. The sides of the Accent have just enough contour and detail to contrast with the front, completing an overall look that is at once mature and modern. The Accent shows that an affordable car can also turn heads around Xenia. Performance The new Hyundai Accent has an inline four-cylinder engine that generates 120 horsepower and 113 pound-feet of torque. The base trim has a six-speed manual transmission with an available Smartstream® Intelligent Variable Transmission. With an estimated highway fuel economy of 39 miles per gallon, you can drive for quite a while in an Accent without having to pull over for gas. Interior and Features The Accent might surprise you with how roomy it is for a compact sedan. With 90.2 cubic feet of passenger volume, up to five passengers will have plenty of room. With 60/40 split fold-down rear seatbacks, the Accent can provide even more space. A total interior volume of 103.9 cubic feet makes the Accent a viable option for hauling luggage on a drive to the airport or moving belongings to a new apartment in Fairborn. The Accent base trim features a five-inch color touchscreen display, which can connect with your smartphone via a USB port. The driver's seat is adjustable six ways, giving you some flexibility to find your most comfortable positioning. Steering-wheel-mounted audio controls make it easy to adjust the volume or change songs on your favorite playlist without taking your eyes off the road, and a Bluetooth® hands-free phone system allows you to make calls without taking your hands off the steering wheel. Save on your next new Hyundai Accent with our new Hyundai specials. Safety The Accent Hyundai lease has plenty of features to help keep you and your passengers safe every time you drive, whether you are running errands around Miamisburg or dropping your kids off at school in Vandalia. Available Hillstart Assist Control makes it easier to get the car started when you are parked on an incline. It works by maintaining brake pressure for two seconds after you release the brakes, giving you time to accelerate without the car rolling. Vehicle stability management is standard, and helps the Accent maintain stability when driving on a slippery road. It works by detecting changes in friction when braking and enhancing the car's stability and steering responses. The SEL and Limited trims have a driver's blind-spot mirror, which can take some of the stress out of changing lanes by increasing the visibility of blind spots. The Limited trim features Forward Collision-Avoidance, which uses a high-resolution camera to scan the road ahead of you, alerts you when a potential collision is imminent, and applies the brakes automatically to prevent a collision.
